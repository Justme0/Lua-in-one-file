# What
This is the source code of Lua in one file.

Roberto Ierusalimschy, the author of Lua, committed a file named onelua.c (https://github.com/lua/lua/blob/master/onelua.c) On Mar 22 2019.
It's so beautiful. For convenience to learn/ship/install Lua, I precompiled the file and formatted it for reading.

# Install
* Method one
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/justme0/Lua-in-one-file
$ cd Lua-in-one-file
$ make
$ make test
```

* Method two
1. Download lua.c
2. $ gcc lua.c
